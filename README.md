# Nuxt Minimal Starter

Inspired by [Boxes.py](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de), I needed a way to conistenly genereate those handy kerfe-patterns by specific parameters and download them as SVGs.

## Development

- ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run preview
```
